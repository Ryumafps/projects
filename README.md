# About Me

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ryumafps

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer science, specifically in Python development and web development using HTML and CSS. Moreover, cybersecurity is a field that greatly intrigues me, and I continuously learn new things about it every day.
  It has been nearly two consecutive years since I have been studying Python both in class and at home, acquiring new skills. Additionally, I'm working to improve my knowledge of HTML and CSS

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HMTL, CSS and PTHON using VSCode and Thonny
